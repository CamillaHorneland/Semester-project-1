                            the Energetics exhibition is coming to the Community

                            <p>It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to
                            experience the power of the elements as we harness them.
                            From solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that
                            shows how turbines are able to use and control wind to
                            create power.</p>

                            <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists
                            have wrestled with the question of our origins.
                            Where do we come from and how did we get
                            here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution
                            we have had a framework for exploring and
                            understanding our place in this world.</p>
                            <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how
                            the species we know today have evolved our time.
                            You can also take some time to meet a few of the
                            creatures who didn’t survive, including our
                            Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of
                            dinosaurs too.</p>

                            <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major
                            breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique
                            insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
                            For many people their life expectancy is much
                            longer and their quality of life much improved,
                            thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine.</p>
                            <p>Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of
                            medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs
                            including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart
                            transplant.</p>
                            <p>Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not
                            only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the
                            wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

                            <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans
                            are having on the planet, the more important it
                            becomes that scientists explore how to create a
                            sustainable future not just for humans but for the
                            whole planet.</p>
                            <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack
                            the dangers we currently face including global
                            warming, extinction of species, and pollution.
                            But we also focus on the positive ways we can
                            all contribute to a brighter future.</p>
