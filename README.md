This is my Semester project 1 - named "Community Science Museum". The project is from my first year as a Font-end Developer student.

# Details: 

This was a 4 week project. We got resourcesfor the project (images and text) that we where free to use.

## Requirements for the project:     
    - The site must be have a design that appeals to the target audience.
    - The site must have at least 4-6 pages.
    - Compositional principles, typography, and color schemes must be considered.
    - Your HTML should be semantic and neatly indented.
    - The site should use external CSS style sheets which follow the DRY principle.
    - The site should download quickly, and not be overly "heavy". Images should not be over 200kb.
    - The site should take WCAG principles into consideration, especially regarding hierarchy, navigation, and color usage.
    - The site should be responsive, attractive, and easy to use on a variety of devices.
    - The site should show consideration for content strategy and SEO (consider your use of meta tags and alt text).
